    <h1>My Name is Terry</h1>

    
    <p>
        I'm a <strong>math</strong> nerd. I love math, especially <strong>integration</strong>. One of the things I used to do was 
        take part in a competetion called the <a href = "https://sites.google.com/apps.losrios.edu/integrationbee2023/official-rules"><strong>Integration Bee</strong></a> that was put on by my Calculus II Professor.
        Doing these was very challanging and I was a far cry from the best integrator,
        but I really enjoyed it anyway. Something else I'm doing is trying to start a <strong>server</strong> at home.
        A friend of mine runs a server and really got me interested in it. My kids like to play <a href = "https://www.minecraft.net"><strong>minecraft</strong></a>
        and I would love to host a server for them and their friends to play on.
